Early in 2020 this portfolio was a school project, but since I've adapted it to become a real presentation website with a resume/about me section, and to display my projects, on behalf of the school or on the side. I'm currently looking for a internship/traineeship between the beginning of may and the mid-June, 6 weeks totals. You can reach me by sending an e-mail via the contact page; I'll be happy to answer any question !</p>
